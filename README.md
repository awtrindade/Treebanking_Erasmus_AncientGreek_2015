## README

This respository documents the treebanking activity for the ERASMUS students 
(March-June 2015, Leipzig University, Humboldt Chair in Digital Humanities) under the supervisor of Dr. Giuseppe G. A. Celano. More precisely, it contains:

* Program/schedule for the treebanking activity
* XML files before tokenization and sentence split (the comment elements within the files specify the edition of the texts)
* XML files after tokenization and sentence split: these have been uploaded on the online <a href="http://sosol.perseids.org/sosol/" target="_blank">Plerseids platform</a> in order to be treebanked
* Inter-coder agreement folder, which documents in detail the files compared

The guildelines are documented and can be consulted in the <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/AGDT2/guidelines" target="_blank">PerseusDL repository</a>)
