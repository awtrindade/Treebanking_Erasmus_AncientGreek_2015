## README

This respository documents the treebanking activity for the ERASMUS students 
(March-June 2015, Leipzig University, Humboldt Chair in Digital Humanities) under the Supervisor of Dr. Giuseppe G. A. Celano. More precisely, it contains:

* Program/schedule for the treebanking activity (the guildelines are contained in the <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/tree/master/AGDT2/guidelines">PerseusDL repository</a>)
* XML files before tokenization and sentence split (the comment elements within the files specify the edition of the texts)
* XML files after tokenization and sentence split: these have been uploaded on the online Plerseids platform in order to be treebanked
* Inter-coder agreement folder, which documents in detail the files compared
